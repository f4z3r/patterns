# `patterns`
An implementation of examples of popular design patterns in Rust. I use this as a personal catalogue to add to if I
stumble upon interesting design patterns and as a reference for famous known patterns.

The famous patterns are mostly from information found online and in
_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented software_. I am aware that Rust is not a per-say object
oriented language as it does not support features such as sub-classing (with code inheritance) but this makes it
more interesting to see how these patterns can be applied to the language.
