# patterns [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jakobbeckmann/patterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jakobbeckmann/patterns)

An implementation of examples of popular design patterns in several languages. I use this as a personal catalogue to add to if I stumble upon interesting design patterns and as simple practice for starting new languages.

The famous patterns are mostly from information found online and in _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented software_. I am aware that some languages here (such as Rust) are not a per-say object oriented language as it does not support features such as sub-classing (with code inheritance) but this makes it more interesting to see how these patterns can be applied to the language.
