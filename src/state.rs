//! State design pattern.
//!
//! # Theory
//! Behavioural software design pattern that implements a state machine in an object-oriented way. With this pattern,
//! a state machine is implemented by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern
//! interface, and implementing state transitions by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.
//!
//! It allows an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its
//! class. This helps avoiding conditional structure in the code where each branch of the conditional structure forms
//! a separate class. State specific behaviour is then localised and new states can be added easily. This prevents
//! inconsistent internal states and state transitions are made explicit.
//!
//! # Participants
//! - `Post`: the context defining a common interface to be used by the clients. This holds an instance of a concrete
//!   state that represents the current state. It delegates state-specific requests to the current concrete state.
//! - `State`: defines the interface for encapsulating the state depedent behaviour.
//! - `Draft`, `PendingReview` and `Published`: concrete states representing different operational states. These
//!   implement behaviour associated with a specific state of the context `Post`. These may access the content of the
//!   context. In general, these can modify the context. However, in Rust, this is not possible (if writing safe code)
//!   as it creates a cycle in the references between the state and the context.
//!
//! # Modifications and Strategies
//! State transitions can be handled either by the context or by the concrete states. Handling in the context makes
//! implementations much easier in Rust. However, in such a centralised case, the states need to be notified when they
//! are activated and deactivated. Otherwise, another solution is to have the states request a state change and have the
//! context execute that state change. Some key can be used to represent the new state that should be adopted (some sort
//! of enumeration).
//!
//! Creating state objects ahead of time and never destroying thme saves time if the state transitions occur rapidly,
//! however the context must hold references to all of them.
//!
//! # Known Uses
//! - "tools" in drawing programs
//! - JDRAW: Handles, SnapToGrid
//! - ticket machines
